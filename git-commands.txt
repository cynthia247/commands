1. To check the status of your git repo

    git status
    
2. If 'git status' indicated that there are changes but they are not staged for commit, add them to the staging area

    git add .

    Or, specify the files individually
    
    git add <file_name>

3. After staging the changes, commit them:

    git commit -m "Your commit message"

4. After commiting push your changes    

    git push

5. To view commit log

    git log --oneline

    To exit from the log
    press 'q'

6. You will see a list of commit. Find the commit you want to restore. Identify the commit hash (e.g., d4e5f6g) before the reset. Once you have identified the commit hash you want to restore, you can reset to that commit.

    git reset --hard d4e5f6g

    Replace d4e5f6g with the actual commit hash from your reflog.

7. Check your repository status by git status again

8. There is another command

    git reset --hard HEAD~1
    
    Adjust HEAD~1 to the number of commits you want to undo
